# FormBuilderDSL
DSL to program forms, developed in Java

To run the program, run the main method of the QL class in the root.
To define a new form, make a textfile, and program your form. Save this textfile in the resources folder. Example forms can be found there.

Supported structures:
Boolean and open questions
Computed questions: Displays the result of a question, or combination of questions, constructed using logic and math operators
Conditional questions: Will only be displayed if a condition is met.
Large set of logic and math operators (+, -, *, /, OR, AND, NEG, POS, NOT)
